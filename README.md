<p>Still in early development and there are many things that needs to be fixed and added! <br></br> Feel free to contribute</p>

## Want to try it out?
Start by cloning or downloading the repo and run the `installer.bat` in the `[installer]` folder as an `Administrator` (Its important to run as admin else it cant finde the Program Files)
<p>Now you can use it by typing in `fstruct` in your console</p>
